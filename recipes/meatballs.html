    <p>
        This recipe, from Daniel Gritzer at <em>Serious Eats</em>, uses buttermilk-soaked bread jellied-then-minced stock to create the
        moistest meatball imaginable.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 packet unflavored gelatin (optional, see notes)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (120ml) homemade chicken stock or low-sodium broth</li>
        <li>3 ounces (85g) crustless fresh white bread, cut into 1/2-inch cubes (about 2 unpacked cups)</li>
        <li>1/3 cup (80ml) buttermilk, plus more as needed</li>
        <li>1 medium (8-ounce; 225g) yellow onion, minced</li>
        <li>3 ounces (85g) fatty pancetta, finely minced</li>
        <li>2 ounces (55g) Parmigiano-Reggiano, grated</li>
        <li>8 medium cloves garlic (about 1 3/4 ounces; 50g), finely minced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup loosely packed fresh parsley leaves (1 ounce; 30g), minced</li>
        <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground fennel seed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Diamond crystal kosher salt (12g)</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pound (455g) ground beef</li>
        <li>1 pound (455g) ground pork</li>
        <li>5 cups (1.2L) tomato sauce</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>In a heatproof measuring cup, sprinkle gelatin all over surface of stock and let stand for 5 minutes. (If not using stock and gelatin, proceed to Step 2.) Microwave stock, stirring once or twice, until gelatin completely dissolves, about 2 minutes. Pour stock into a wide heatproof bowl and refrigerate until fully set, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine bread with buttermilk, tossing to coat. Let stand, tossing occasionally, until bread is completely moist, about 10 minutes. Squeeze bread between your fingers or mash with a spoon to make sure there are no dry spots; if there are dry spots that refuse to moisten, add more buttermilk, 1 tablespoon at a time, until bread is moist throughout.</li>
        <li>Add onion, pancetta, Parmigiano-Reggiano, garlic, parsley, egg yolks, oregano, fennel, salt, and pepper to bread/buttermilk mixture. Finely mince gelled stock, if using, and add.</li>
        <li>Set mixer bowl in stand mixer and attach paddle. Starting at low speed and gradually increasing to medium-high speed, beat bread mixture until thoroughly blended, stopping to scrape down sides as necessary. Add 1/3 each of the beef and pork and beat at medium-high speed until thoroughly blended with bread mixture.</li>
        <li>Remove bowl from stand mixer and add remaining beef and pork. Using a clean hand, gently mix meatball mixture, teasing apart ground meat with your fingers, just until ground beef and pork are thoroughly mixed in and no pockets of unincorporated meat remain; avoid mixing any more than is necessary for even distribution.</li>
        <li>Preheat broiler and set oven rack in upper position. Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Form meatball mixture into handball-sized balls and arrange on prepared baking sheet; you should be able to make about 10. Broil meatballs until browned on top, about 7 minutes. (Browning times can vary dramatically, depending on oven broiler strength.)</li>
        <li>Heat tomato sauce in a medium pot until simmering and add meatballs. Simmer until meatballs are just cooked through and register about 145°F (63°C) on an instant-read thermometer, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve meatballs, spooning sauce all over and grating more cheese on top.</li>
    </ol>
